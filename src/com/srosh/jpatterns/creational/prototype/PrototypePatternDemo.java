/**
 * Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind.
 * This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
 * This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface which tells to create a clone of the current object.
 * This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly. For example, an object is to be created after a costly database operation.
 * We can cache the object, returns its clone on next request and update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.
