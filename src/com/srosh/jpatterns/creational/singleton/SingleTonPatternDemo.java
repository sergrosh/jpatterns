/**
 * Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java.
 * This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
 * This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.
 * This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
